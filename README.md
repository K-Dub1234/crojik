# WHITEPAPER
### Holding
#### To hold crojik's coin, CROW, you must have set up a Masternode. Holding CROW helps the network's stability and makes *sailing* eaisier.
### Sailing
#### To sail is to Buy or Sell CROW tokens. **Ex:** *Jimmy has 200 CROW, and wants to sell 100 CROW, this will be made easier if he is already holding at least double the amount of CROW he wants to sell. The same goes for buying.*
### Crowjacking (mining)
#### The process of Crowjacking, or mining, is when a miner's core is enabled by a new transaction on the *PHO* network.
### PHO network
#### The Pho network is the network that transactions take place, and blocks are stored.
